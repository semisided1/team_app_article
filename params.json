{"name":"Team app article","tagline":"Exploring Team Apps","body":"# Exploring team / group applications\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why team apps are awesome\r\n\r\n- continuous dialog in central location\r\n- no email lists\r\n- opt-in opt-out\r\n- creates momentum\r\n- this is how real world teams operate now (adapt or die)\r\n- creates community\r\n- asynchronous so you can do it when you are free\r\n- topical / focused\r\n- searchable\r\n\r\n\r\n## Common team apps\r\n\r\n- Facebook groups\r\n- Slack\r\n- bulletin boards (phpbb)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Slack is good\r\n- __topical__. Topics are persistent by creating channels.\r\n\r\n- __central__. One place for team communication visible by everyone on the team.\r\n\r\n- __extendable__. Its easy to get started, can be increasingly more\r\nuseful with integrations which are not in the way at the start. Useful integrations\r\ninclude: google drive, google maps, google hangouts\r\n\r\n- __sharing__. Share any type of files - pdf, zip, docx, whatever\r\n\r\n- __expressive__. More reactions (like, dislike, ... ), emoticons built into\r\nchat just type :\r\n\r\n- __notifications__. Configure notifications snooze / disable / enable ...\r\n\r\n- __culture__. Focused users will administer slack because its productive. Slack\r\ngroups tend to be very friendly because they are a tighter community.\r\n\r\n- __help__. The help center is easy to understand.\r\n\r\n- __easy__.\r\n\r\n- its not facebook\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Slack is bad\r\n- many people love facebook.\r\n- less share integrations on other pages like Youtube. Cut and paste url's ew.\r\n\r\n## Why Facebook groups are bad\r\n\r\n- __culture__. We do not take stuff there seriously while its mixed in with jokes.\r\n\r\n- __unsearchable__. Chat history unsearchable.\r\n\r\n- __disjointed__. New topics are are created with each post (which usually get hijacked)\r\n\r\n- __perplexing__. Facebook decides when something is important to you, you might miss something\r\nin feed\r\n\r\n- __clutter__. People have a tendency to have a lot of other stuff going on in\r\nFacebook. Wasted screen space for undirected activities like ads and games.\r\n\r\n- __app bloat__. The site and the app are too resource intensive on many devices.\r\n\r\n- __perception__. If you are in a work setting you do not want to be in\r\nFacebook because the perception is that you are wasting time.\r\n\r\n- __missed messages__. A team may be made up of non - friends which makes\r\nit hard to communicate directly since facebook hides msgs from non - friends.\r\n\r\n- __privacy__. your friends list and fb posts are a way for non friends to snoop, when you post in\r\na group people will see who your friends are, what your public facing profile is\r\nand what you post in there, which takes away from any kind of point you may have\r\nbeen making in the group discussion. Though this may be configurable, its complex.\r\n\r\n- __profile management__. Facebook has become about how you represent yourself\r\nover time, you do not need any of that to work in a team and its a distraction\r\nto you and your team members.\r\n\r\n- __limited sharing__. File attachments are limited to photos and videos, external links are handled in\r\na strange way.\r\n\r\n- __advertising__.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nSlack is more functional and accessible than Facebook. Facebook\r\nis good enough for many people but, in the end, it fails in many ways because of\r\nits culture and purpose. Team apps save time.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
